     * Server Actions Testing Strategy:
     *
     * For this template, we've chosen to test Server Actions primarily through:
     *
     * 1. E2E Tests: Comprehensive tests that validate the full flow from form submission
     *    to database operations and redirects in tests/e2e/auth/registration.spec.ts
     *
     * 2. Unit Tests: Limited to form validations in the component rather than
     *    testing the server action directly, which requires complex mocking of:
     *    - Prisma DB connections
     *    - NextAuth.js session handling
     *    - Redis connections (for rate limiting)
     *    - Transaction management
     *
     * This approach provides good coverage while maintaining test simplicity and reliability.
     * The E2E tests verify the actual behavior from the user's perspective.
