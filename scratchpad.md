# Scratchpad - Work Phase

**NOTES:**

- All To Do items should be added as checklists.
- Do not check something off unless you're confident it's complete.
- Reorganize now and then, putting unfinished tasks at the top and finished ones at the bottom.

## Current Story

**Story 005**: Create text input UI component  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Link**: /docs/stories/story-005-text-input-ui.md

## Current Task

Story 005 MVP is complete! TextInputForm component is fully functional with:

- ✅ Large text area with examples
- ✅ Parse Events button with loading states
- ✅ Clear button functionality
- ✅ Mock event results display
- ✅ Error handling ready
- ✅ Material UI styling
- ✅ Responsive design

Ready to move to **Story 004: Implement OpenAI text processing service** to hook up real AI processing.

## Plan Checklist

### Story 005 Tasks - ✅ ALL COMPLETE

- [x] Create story file with detailed requirements
- [x] Design component structure and props interface
- [x] Create `TextInputForm` component with large text area
- [x] Add "Parse Events" button with loading states
- [x] Implement basic form validation (non-empty text)
- [x] Add placeholder text with usage examples
- [x] Create processing/loading state UI
- [x] Add error handling for failed parsing
- [x] Style component with Material UI theme
- [x] Make component responsive
- [x] Integrate into test page (/test-component)
- [x] Test component functionality end-to-end
- [x] User sign-off on MVP functionality ✅

### Next: Story 004 - OpenAI AI Processing Service

- [ ] Set up OpenAI API account and obtain API key
- [ ] Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment variables
- [ ] Install OpenAI SDK package (`npm install openai`)
- [ ] Create `lib/ai.ts` service module
- [ ] Define `ExtractedEventData` TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Build AI text processing function
- [ ] Hook TextInputForm to real AI processing
- [ ] Test end-to-end AI integration
- [ ] User sign-off on AI functionality

## Issues/Blockers

None! Ready to proceed to AI integration.

## Recently Completed ✅

- Successfully created MVP TextInputForm component
- Added component to test page at /test-component
- Made /test-component publicly accessible
- Tested all component functionality (input, parse, clear, results display)
- Component ready for AI integration hook-up

## Decisions Made

- Used MVP approach - build basic UI first, then add AI processing
- Created mock data system for testing UI before AI integration
- Used Material UI for consistent styling with rest of app
- Added developer JSON output for debugging
- Made component flexible with onParseEvents prop for easy AI integration

## Lessons Learned

- Testing UI components in isolation (without auth) speeds up development
- Mock data helps validate UI behavior before complex integrations
- MaterialUI + NextJS integration works smoothly
- Component-first approach makes testing easier
