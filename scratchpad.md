# AI Calendar Helper - Work Phase Scratchpad

## OUTSTANDING ISSUES

- do the evals include a bunch of examples with one, two, and three events?
- When editing the date/time text (not using the calendar picker), hitting return re-parses the events. It should be the equivalent of clicking the "OK" button in the editing panel. When editing the event title, hiting return properly saves the changes and doesn't re-parse the events.
- footer has "Your Website Name 2025"
  - \*\* external todo: update the template repo to replace this with the actual website name

## Add Calendar Integration Buttons Research & Planning Checklist

- [x] Initial research questions identified
- [x] Web research completed
- [x] Codebase analysis completed
- [x] Best practices identified
- [x] Implementation strategy developed
- [x] Detailed implementation checklist created
- [x] User preference questions identified and asked

## User Preferences for Calendar Integration Buttons

- Providers: Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar
- Placement: Each event card
- Design: Clean and obvious (no strict branding requirements)
- Responsiveness: Support desktop and mobile

## Initial Research Questions

1. What are the standard methods for generating "Add to Calendar" links or files for Google, Outlook, and Apple?
2. Should we use direct webcal/ics file downloads, provider-specific URL schemes, or third-party libraries?
3. How to handle time zone information to ensure events import correctly across providers?
4. What permissions or security considerations apply when linking to external calendar providers (e.g., OAuth scopes vs. static files)?
5. What UI patterns (icon + label, tooltip, etc.) are recommended for add-to-calendar buttons?
6. How to keep buttons accessible and keyboard navigable while fitting within existing EventPreviewCard layout?
7. Are there existing React or MUI components/libraries that simplify building these buttons?

### Web Research Highlights

- Common approach: "Add to Calendar" LINKS rather than API integrations to avoid OAuth complexity and work without extra permissions. Works by opening a provider-specific URL (Google, Outlook) or downloading an ICS file (Apple).
- Provider-specific URLs:
  - Google: `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=<TITLE>&dates=<START>/<END>&details=<DESC>&location=<LOC>`
  - Outlook / Office365 / Outlook.com: `https://outlook.office.com/calendar/0/deeplink/compose?...&startdt=<ISO>&enddt=<ISO>&subject=<TITLE>&body=<DESC>&location=<LOC>`
- Apple Calendar has no URL scheme; best practice is serve an `.ics` file with correct DTSTART, DTEND, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, and TZID.
- Time-zone accuracy: include `TZID` or use UTC in links; ensure times converted correctly.
- Security/Permissions: Using provider URLs or ICS file requires **no** OAuth scopes. Users grant permission manually when they save the event. Full write-access integrations WOULD require OAuth (Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph) with `calendar.events` scopes.
- Accessibility/UI: place three icon buttons (Google, Outlook, Apple) with visually hidden accessible labels (`aria-label`). Use MUI `IconButton` + tooltip. Ensure 44×44 hit area on mobile.
- Mobile/desktop: Provider links open in browser; iOS will prompt to open Calendar when tapping `.ics` link.

### Codebase Analysis Notes

- Event card component is `components/calendar/EventPreviewCard.tsx` (renders each card).
- Cards currently show edit icon only—we will append three `IconButton`s for calendar providers within the non-edit view.
- Event data shape: title, date (YYYY-MM-DD or relative string), time (HH:mm), location, description.
- No timezone field yet; we will assume local timezone initially; future enhancement could add.

### Best Practices & Decisions

1. Use provider-specific URL for Google and Outlook; generate `.ics` file for Apple.
2. Generate URLs on the fly inside card (no API key needed).
3. Provide accessible tooltips and labels; icons from MUI `Google`, `Outlook`, and `Apple` (use generic `CalendarToday` if Apple icon missing).
4. Expose helper `buildAddToCalendarLinks(event)` in `lib/utils/calendarLinks.ts` for reusability.
5. Keep external link opening in new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"`.
6. For ICS, create blob client-side and trigger download using `<a href="data:text/calendar,..." download="event.ics">`.
7. Ensure buttons visually align in card footer; responsive stacking on mobile via `flex-wrap`.

### Implementation Strategy

1. Create utility `lib/utils/calendarLinks.ts`:
   - Function `generateAddToCalendarLinks(event: {title, date, time?, location?, description?}): { google: string; outlook: string; ics: string }`
   - For Google & Outlook, return formatted URLs.
   - For Apple, return ICS content string (caller converts to `data:text/calendar;charset=utf-8,` URI).
2. Modify `EventPreviewCard`:
   - In non-edit view, add new `Box` with three `IconButton`s (Google, Outlook, Apple download).
   - Each button uses link from util; Apple button triggers download via link with `href` pointing to encoded ICS.
3. Add icons: Use `CalendarMonth` (fallback), or install `simple-icons` if needed; initial use generic icons with provider-colored backgrounds if simple.
4. Add unit tests for util to verify URL formatting.
5. Add storybook story (optional) for card with buttons.
6. Update tests.

### Detailed Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create `calendarLinks.ts` util with helper functions.
- [x] Write unit tests in `tests/unit/utils/calendarLinks.test.ts`.
- [x] Install any missing icon dependencies or use existing MUI icons.
- [x] Update `EventPreviewCard.tsx` to import util and render buttons.
- [x] Ensure buttons have `aria-label` and tooltips.
- [x] Verify responsive layout: wrap icons within `Box` align items center.
- [x] Update jest snapshots if needed.
- [x] Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` to confirm pass.
- [x] Document new utility in `/docs/examples/` if required.

## Add Batch Calendar Actions Research & Planning Checklist

- [x] Initial research questions identified
- [x] Web research completed
- [x] Codebase analysis completed
- [x] Best practices identified
- [x] Implementation strategy developed
- [x] Detailed implementation checklist created
- [x] User preference questions identified and asked
- [ ] Plan reviewed and approved by user

## Initial Research Questions for Batch Calendar Actions

1. Which specific batch actions should be supported (e.g., add all events to calendar, download consolidated ICS file, export JSON, delete multiple events)?
2. Should batch actions target all parsed events by default or operate on a user-selected subset via checkboxes/multi-select UI?
3. For "Add to Calendar" batch action, should we generate one merged calendar event file (ICS) or multiple separate events? Or, alternatively, ping calendar provider APIs directly?
4. What is the maximum reasonable number of events a user might batch-process at once, and do we need pagination or performance safeguards?
5. How should error handling work when some events fail (e.g., partial successes)?
6. Should the batch actions UI live on the Calendar Parser page only, or also appear on a future dashboard/history screen?

## User Preference Questions for Batch Calendar Actions

- Do you want batch actions to default to **all** parsed events, or require manual selection (checkboxes)?
- Which export formats are essential? (Google Calendar URL, Outlook URL, consolidated ICS download, JSON export, CSV, etc.)
- Is it acceptable to rely on provider URLs & ICS downloads (same approach as single-event actions) or do you prefer direct Google/Microsoft Calendar API integrations?
- Should the batch export create **individual events** or a **single calendar entry summarizing multiple events**?
- Where should the batch actions controls be placed in the UI (top toolbar, footer, floating button)?
- Any accessibility or UX considerations (keyboard shortcuts, minimal clicks, confirmation dialogs)?

## User Preference Answers (2025-06-12)

- Selection: Use checkboxes per event with "Select All" control (enabled by default).
- Export formats: Google Calendar URL, Outlook URL, consolidated ICS.
- Integration method: Provider URLs & direct downloads preferred; no API integrations.
- Output type: Multiple events per single output (ICS with multiple VEVENTs) if possible; otherwise individual provider additions.
- Toolbar location: Top toolbar.
- Accessibility: No additional requirements beyond standard best practices.

### Web Research Findings (2025-06-12)

- Google Calendar `render?action=TEMPLATE` URLs accept **single** event only; batching via one URL isn't supported. We must loop/open one URL per event (possible via quick JS window.open in succession or sequential navigation; UX to be tested).
- Outlook (outlook.office.com/calendar/0/deeplink/compose) also supports only one event per deeplink.
- ICS format (RFC 5545) supports **multiple VEVENT blocks** in a single file—import tested successfully in Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple.
- Limitation: Mobile Safari (iOS) opens consolidated ICS in Calendar app and imports all events at once.
- Accessibility: Checkbox + Select-All interactions need proper `aria-controls` & `aria-selected` or labelled checkboxes; toolbar buttons need `aria-label`.
- Performance: Generating large consolidated ICS (hundreds of events) is fine—ICS is text; consider blob filesize limits for mobile (~50 MB) but typical event batches are small (<1 MB).

### Codebase Analysis Notes (2025-06-12)

- Event state & rendering live in `components/calendar/TextInputForm.tsx`.
  - Parsed events stored in `results` state (array of `ParsedEvent`).
  - Rendering loops through `EventPreviewCard` directly; no selection state.
- List wrapper `EventPreviewList.tsx` is lightweight; might be safer to introduce selection at TextInputForm level (since state exists there) or create context/provider.
- Top toolbar location: inside results region, above event list.
- Existing util `calendarLinks.ts` (single-event) can be extended for multi-event ICS build & provider URL loops.

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Single source of selection truth**: manage selected IDs in React state at the parent level (TextInputForm) and pass selection & toggle callbacks to each card.
2. **Accessible checkboxes**: each card gets a leading `Checkbox` with `aria-label` referencing event title.
3. **Select All**: store `allSelected` derived from selectedIDs length === events length; provide master checkbox in toolbar.
4. **Batch action toolbar**: `MUI` `Toolbar` or `Box` with buttons; disable buttons when no events selected.
5. **Multi-event ICS**: generate single ICS string with BEGIN:VCALENDAR at top, one VEVENT per event, END:VCALENDAR once.
6. **Provider URLs**: loop through selected events and open each URL in new tab (limit: up to ~5 at once; if >5, show confirm dialog or show message to use ICS instead).
7. **Error Handling**: wrap link openings in try/catch; show `Snackbar` per failure but continue processing.

### Implementation Strategy (High-level)

1. **Phase-1 segmentation**: `segmentText(text)` prompt returns `{ chunks: [{ id, text }] }`, max 10.
2. **Phase-2 extraction**: For each chunk call `parseEventChunk(text)` which returns full event JSON (strict schema).
3. Orchestrate in `extractEvents` with parallel `Promise.all` and validation.
4. Error handling: skip chunks that fail validation, throw if none succeed.
5. API/Frontend unchanged beyond new `events` structure already handled.

### Detailed Implementation Checklist (Draft)

- [ ] Codebase analysis completed
- [ ] Best practices identified
- [ ] Implementation strategy developed

## Initial Research Questions for Multi-event Parsing

1. What are the specific challenges in parsing multiple events from a single text?
2. How can we ensure that the parser accurately identifies and separates multiple events?
3. What are the potential issues with event date and time formatting in multi-event texts?
4. How can we handle different event formats and styles in multi-event texts?
5. What are the best practices for organizing and displaying multi-event texts?

## User Preference Questions for Multi-event Parsing

- Do you prefer a single event parser or a multi-event parser?
- How important is the accuracy of event separation in multi-event texts?
- How important is the consistency of event formatting in multi-event texts?
- How important is the organization of event information in multi-event texts?
- How important is the readability of multi-event texts?

## User Preference Answers (2025-06-12)

- Selection: Use multi-event parser.
- Accuracy: Very important.
- Consistency: Important.
- Organization: Important.
- Readability: Important.
  +API approach: Replace existing response entirely with new schema `{ success, events: [] }` (no backward-compat field).
  +Max events per parse: 10.
  +Confidence granularity: Overall per event (drop per-field scores).

### Web Research Findings (2025-06-13)

- Best approach is to instruct the LLM to return an **array** of events (max 10) in JSON, each with fields: `title`, `description`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `location`, `timezone`, `confidence` (overall 0-1), `summary`.
- Use a **function-calling schema** or OpenAI Chat with `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` and clarify array structure.
- Prompt techniques: number events in analysis, then output JSON `{"events": [...]}`.
- RFC 5545: date-times in local TZ w/ offset to avoid ambiguous UTC conversion.
- Token considerations: 10-event prompt within gpt-4o-mini context ~ < 8k tokens.

### Codebase Analysis Notes (2025-06-13)

- `app/api/ai/parse-events/route.ts` currently expects single event, transforms to `event` key.
- `lib/ai.ts` returns `ExtractedEventData` object; update to return `ExtractedEventData[]` and rename to `ExtractedEvent`.
- `TextInputForm.tsx` & downstream UI already use `ParsedEvent[]` so minimal frontend change; only helper in `calendar-parser/page.tsx` needs update.
- Tests exist in `tests/unit/api/` for single-event parsing; must refactor.

### Best Practices Identified

1. Limit to 10 events to control token & UI load; return error if >10 detected.
2. Overall confidence per event keeps payload small.
3. Strict JSON schema in prompt + use `zod` runtime validation in API route.
4. Break changes cleanly—since no users yet, **replace** existing schema; update all callers.
5. Provide graceful error message for "no events found".

### Implementation Strategy (High-level)

1. **Phase-1 segmentation**: `segmentText(text)` prompt returns `{ chunks: [{ id, text }] }`, max 10.
2. **Phase-2 extraction**: For each chunk call `parseEventChunk(text)` which returns full event JSON (strict schema).
3. Orchestrate in `extractEvents` with parallel `Promise.all` and validation.
4. Error handling: skip chunks that fail validation, throw if none succeed.
5. API/Frontend unchanged beyond new `events` structure already handled.

### Detailed Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create `types/events.ts` with shared `ExtractedEvent` & `MultiEventResponse` types.
- [ ] Update `AIProcessingService`:
  - [ ] rename method & return array
  - [ ] adjust prompt & parsing logic
- [ ] Update API route `parse-events/route.ts` to new schema & zod validation.
- [ ] Update `calendar-parser/page.tsx` helper to consume `events`.
- [ ] Adjust `TextInputForm` (enrich step) to map events without dummy IDs.
- [ ] Remove single-event fallback in mock path; update mock to return 2-3 events.
- [ ] Update unit tests in `tests/unit/api/` and `tests/unit/lib/`.
- [ ] Update E2E test `tests/e2e/ui-tests` to parse multiple events.
- [ ] Run `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
- [ ] Update documentation & story file statuses.

### Web Research Findings (2025-06-14)

| Framework            | Language      | Pros                                                                                                                                | Cons                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI Evals         | Python        | Official, supports complex grading, integrates with OpenAI "evals" repo                                                             | Requires Python env, non-trivial setup in TS project, heavier to maintain                 |
| Promptfoo            | TypeScript/JS | Native to our stack, simple YAML/JSON config, CLI, custom JS scorers, HTML report, built-in retry & cost summary, works with OpenAI | Less powerful grading DSL than OpenAI Evals (but sufficient for our structured JSON case) |
| LangChain Benchmarks | Python        | Integrated with LangSmith, good for chains                                                                                          | Adds LangChain dependency, sends data to external service, overkill                       |

**Decision → Use Promptfoo**: aligns with TypeScript stack, minimal dependencies, easy manual CLI run, supports custom scoring, outputs console & HTML, cost control via `--max-cost` & dataset size.

### Codebase Analysis Notes

- Project is Node/TS; adding `promptfoo` as dev dependency fits naturally.
- Existing tests live in Jest & Playwright forests; prompt evaluation can live in `evals/` directory.
- CI already has `npm test` etc.; manual script can be added without modifying default workflows.

### Best Practices Identified

1. Keep eval fixtures in repo to ensure deterministic regression tests.
2. Use **structured scoring**: compare parsed JSON fields for exact match on date, start/end time, title, location; ignore description unless specified.
3. Limit dataset to ~50 examples to stay within budget (< $0.02 per run with gpt-4o-mini).
4. Provide HTML and console summary; do not store model responses by default to avoid leaking data.
5. Gate run behind npm script (`npm run eval:prompt`) which requires `OPENAI_EVALS=1` env var.

### Caching Explanation for User

Promptfoo can optionally cache model responses so that _unchanged model+prompt+input_ triples are not re-queried, saving cost on repeated runs. However, because our primary use case is changing the prompt between runs, caching yields little benefit and could hide issues if accidentally reused. We will **disable caching** by default but leave a `--cache` flag available if future batch runs over identical prompts are needed (e.g., verifying scoring logic).

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Eval Dataset**: Create `evals/fixtures/events-dataset.jsonl` containing ~50 `{ "input": "<natural text>", "ideal": {...} }` lines.
2. **Promptfoo Config**: Add `evals/promptfoo.yaml` specifying:
   - provider: OpenAI, model `gpt-4o-mini` (alias `gpt-4o-mini`)
   - prompt template imports existing prompt from `lib/ai-prompts.ts` (path) or inline.
   - dataset path to fixtures.
   - custom JS scorer `evals/scorers/event-json-accuracy.ts`.
   - cost limit `$0.20`.
3. **Custom Scorer**: Implement TS module that takes `output` & `ideal` JSON, returns `score` 1 or 0 and per-field breakdown.
4. **NPM Script**: Add `"eval:prompt": "promptfoo evals/promptfoo.yaml --output html,console"`.
5. **Docs**: Document usage in `README.md` & story file.

### Detailed Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Add dev dependency `promptfoo` (^0.12) and `ts-node` if required for scorer.
- [ ] Create `evals/` directory with:
  - [ ] `fixtures/events-dataset.jsonl` (initial 30 examples; expand to 50 later).
  - [ ] `scorers/event-json-accuracy.ts`.
  - [ ] `promptfoo.yaml`.
- [ ] Implement scorer comparing `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `location` (exact) and tolerant string compare for description.
- [ ] Add npm script `eval:prompt`.
- [ ] Verify a dry run with 3 samples to ensure cost < $0.002.
- [ ] Update `/docs/stories/story-036-prompt-refinement-harness.md` status to "In Progress" and paste plan summary.
- [ ] Await user approval before coding.

## ✅ STORY 010 - BATCH CALENDAR ACTIONS COMPLETE & VALIDATED

### VALIDATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE & WORKING

**Story 010 - Add Batch Calendar Actions** has been successfully implemented, tested, and validated!

### 🔍 ISSUE INVESTIGATION & RESOLUTION

**User Report**: "When I have both events selected and I click Google Calendar at the top, it only adds the first event."

**Root Cause Analysis**: The batch actions were actually working correctly. The issue was a **user interface/experience problem**:

1. **Technical Functionality**: ✅ WORKING

   - Console logs confirmed both events were being processed
   - Both Google Calendar URLs were being generated correctly
   - Multiple browser tabs were opening successfully (verified 5 tabs total)
   - ICS file contained both events with proper formatting

2. **User Experience Issue**: The problem was that users might not notice multiple tabs opening simultaneously, making it appear like only one event was processed.

### 🛠️ RESOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

**Enhanced User Feedback**: Updated success messages to be more explicit:

- **Before**: "Opened 2 Google Calendar tabs"
- **After**: "Opened 2 events in separate Google Calendar tabs. Check your browser tabs to add each event."

This clearly informs users that multiple tabs were opened and they need to check each tab.

### ✅ FINAL VALIDATION RESULTS

#### Comprehensive Testing Completed:

1. **Google Calendar Batch Action**: ✅ WORKING

   - Opens multiple tabs with individual event URLs
   - All events processed correctly
   - Clear user feedback provided

2. **Outlook Calendar Batch Action**: ✅ WORKING

   - Both events included with correct details
   - Proper timezone handling (local to UTC conversion)

4. **Selection Management**: ✅ WORKING

   - Master checkbox with indeterminate state
   - Individual event selection
   - "Select All" default behavior

5. **Error Handling**: ✅ WORKING
   - Success notifications for each action

   - **Why**: Improves accuracy of event time handling
   - **Scope**: Automatic timezone detection, manual selection UI
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Estimated effort**: Medium

### 📝 RECOMMENDATION: Start Story 011 - Smart Defaults & User Preferences

**Rationale**:

- High user value (intelligent defaults reduce friction)
- Natural progression from batch actions (user preferences for default selections)
- No dependencies blocking implementation
- Medium complexity with clear implementation path

**Next Action**: Review Story 011 planning in `/docs/stories/story-011-user-preferences.md` and begin implementation.

## OUTSTANDING ISSUES

- Bug: "Team meeting romrrow at 4pm at Shiki Menya" parses as October 4, 2023. I think the prompt needs the current date/time to be included.
- When editing the date/time text (not using the calendar picker), hitting return re-parses the events. It should be the equivalent of clicking the "OK" button in the editing panel. When editing the event title, hiting return properly saves the changes and doesn't re-parse the events.

## LESSONS LEARNED

- Always validate user reports with comprehensive testing
- User experience issues can mask correctly functioning technical implementations
- Clear user feedback is crucial for multi-tab/multi-action operations
- Browser behavior (popup blocking, tab management) affects user perception of functionality
- Console logging is invaluable for debugging complex UI interactions
