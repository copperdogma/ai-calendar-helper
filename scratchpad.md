## User Preferences for Calendar Integration Buttons

- Providers: Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar
- Placement: Each event card
- Design: Clean and obvious (no strict branding requirements)
- Responsiveness: Support desktop and mobile

## Initial Research Questions

1. What are the standard methods for generating "Add to Calendar" links or files for Google, Outlook, and Apple?
2. Should we use direct webcal/ics file downloads, provider-specific URL schemes, or third-party libraries?
3. How to handle time zone information to ensure events import correctly across providers?
4. What permissions or security considerations apply when linking to external calendar providers (e.g., OAuth scopes vs. static files)?
5. What UI patterns (icon + label, tooltip, etc.) are recommended for add-to-calendar buttons?
6. How to keep buttons accessible and keyboard navigable while fitting within existing EventPreviewCard layout?
7. Are there existing React or MUI components/libraries that simplify building these buttons?

### Web Research Highlights

- Common approach: "Add to Calendar" LINKS rather than API integrations to avoid OAuth complexity and work without extra permissions. Works by opening a provider-specific URL (Google, Outlook) or downloading an ICS file (Apple).
- Provider-specific URLs:
  - Google: `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=<TITLE>&dates=<START>/<END>&details=<DESC>&location=<LOC>`
  - Outlook / Office365 / Outlook.com: `https://outlook.office.com/calendar/0/deeplink/compose?...&startdt=<ISO>&enddt=<ISO>&subject=<TITLE>&body=<DESC>&location=<LOC>`
- Apple Calendar has no URL scheme; best practice is serve an `.ics` file with correct DTSTART, DTEND, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, and TZID.
- Time-zone accuracy: include `TZID` or use UTC in links; ensure times converted correctly.
- Security/Permissions: Using provider URLs or ICS file requires **no** OAuth scopes. Users grant permission manually when they save the event. Full write-access integrations WOULD require OAuth (Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph) with `calendar.events` scopes.
- Accessibility/UI: place three icon buttons (Google, Outlook, Apple) with visually hidden accessible labels (`aria-label`). Use MUI `IconButton` + tooltip. Ensure 44Ã—44 hit area on mobile.
- Mobile/desktop: Provider links open in browser; iOS will prompt to open Calendar when tapping `.ics` link.

### Codebase Analysis Notes

- Event card component is `components/calendar/EventPreviewCard.tsx` (renders each card).
- Cards currently show edit icon onlyâ€”we will append three `IconButton`s for calendar providers within the non-edit view.
- Event data shape: title, date (YYYY-MM-DD or relative string), time (HH:mm), location, description.
- No timezone field yet; we will assume local timezone initially; future enhancement could add.

### Best Practices & Decisions

1. Use provider-specific URL for Google and Outlook; generate `.ics` file for Apple.
2. Generate URLs on the fly inside card (no API key needed).
3. Provide accessible tooltips and labels; icons from MUI `Google`, `Outlook`, and `Apple` (use generic `CalendarToday` if Apple icon missing).
4. Expose helper `buildAddToCalendarLinks(event)` in `lib/utils/calendarLinks.ts` for reusability.
5. Keep external link opening in new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"`.
6. For ICS, create blob client-side and trigger download using `<a href="data:text/calendar,..." download="event.ics">`.
7. Ensure buttons visually align in card footer; responsive stacking on mobile via `flex-wrap`.

### Implementation Strategy

1. Create utility `lib/utils/calendarLinks.ts`:
   - Function `generateAddToCalendarLinks(event: {title, date, time?, location?, description?}): { google: string; outlook: string; ics: string }`
   - For Google & Outlook, return formatted URLs.
   - For Apple, return ICS content string (caller converts to `data:text/calendar;charset=utf-8,` URI).
2. Modify `EventPreviewCard`:
   - In non-edit view, add new `Box` with three `IconButton`s (Google, Outlook, Apple download).
   - Each button uses link from util; Apple button triggers download via link with `href` pointing to encoded ICS.
3. Add icons: Use `CalendarMonth` (fallback), or install `simple-icons` if needed; initial use generic icons with provider-colored backgrounds if simple.
4. Add unit tests for util to verify URL formatting.
5. Add storybook story (optional) for card with buttons.
6. Update tests.

### Detailed Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create `calendarLinks.ts` util with helper functions.
- [x] Write unit tests in `tests/unit/utils/calendarLinks.test.ts`.
- [x] Install any missing icon dependencies or use existing MUI icons.
- [x] Update `EventPreviewCard.tsx` to import util and render buttons.
- [x] Ensure buttons have `aria-label` and tooltips.
- [x] Verify responsive layout: wrap icons within `Box` align items center.
- [x] Update jest snapshots if needed.
- [x] Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` to confirm pass.
- [x] Document new utility in `/docs/examples/` if required.

## Initial Research Questions for Batch Calendar Actions

1. Which specific batch actions should be supported (e.g., add all events to calendar, download consolidated ICS file, export JSON, delete multiple events)?
2. Should batch actions target all parsed events by default or operate on a user-selected subset via checkboxes/multi-select UI?
3. For "Add to Calendar" batch action, should we generate one merged calendar event file (ICS) or multiple separate events? Or, alternatively, ping calendar provider APIs directly?
4. What is the maximum reasonable number of events a user might batch-process at once, and do we need pagination or performance safeguards?
5. How should error handling work when some events fail (e.g., partial successes)?
6. Should the batch actions UI live on the Calendar Parser page only, or also appear on a future dashboard/history screen?

## User Preference Questions for Batch Calendar Actions

- Do you want batch actions to default to **all** parsed events, or require manual selection (checkboxes)?
- Which export formats are essential? (Google Calendar URL, Outlook URL, consolidated ICS download, JSON export, CSV, etc.)
- Is it acceptable to rely on provider URLs & ICS downloads (same approach as single-event actions) or do you prefer direct Google/Microsoft Calendar API integrations?
- Should the batch export create **individual events** or a **single calendar entry summarizing multiple events**?
- Where should the batch actions controls be placed in the UI (top toolbar, footer, floating button)?
- Any accessibility or UX considerations (keyboard shortcuts, minimal clicks, confirmation dialogs)?

## User Preference Answers (2025-06-12)

- Selection: Use checkboxes per event with "Select All" control (enabled by default).
- Export formats: Google Calendar URL, Outlook URL, consolidated ICS.
- Integration method: Provider URLs & direct downloads preferred; no API integrations.
- Output type: Multiple events per single output (ICS with multiple VEVENTs) if possible; otherwise individual provider additions.
- Toolbar location: Top toolbar.
- Accessibility: No additional requirements beyond standard best practices.

### Web Research Findings (2025-06-12)

- Google Calendar `render?action=TEMPLATE` URLs accept **single** event only; batching via one URL isn't supported. We must loop/open one URL per event (possible via quick JS window.open in succession or sequential navigation; UX to be tested).
- Outlook (outlook.office.com/calendar/0/deeplink/compose) also supports only one event per deeplink.
- ICS format (RFC 5545) supports **multiple VEVENT blocks** in a single fileâ€”import tested successfully in Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple.
- Limitation: Mobile Safari (iOS) opens consolidated ICS in Calendar app and imports all events at once.
- Accessibility: Checkbox + Select-All interactions need proper `aria-controls` & `aria-selected` or labelled checkboxes; toolbar buttons need `aria-label`.
- Performance: Generating large consolidated ICS (hundreds of events) is fineâ€”ICS is text; consider blob filesize limits for mobile (~50 MB) but typical event batches are small (<1 MB).

### Codebase Analysis Notes (2025-06-12)

- Event state & rendering live in `components/calendar/TextInputForm.tsx`.
  - Parsed events stored in `results` state (array of `ParsedEvent`).
  - Rendering loops through `EventPreviewCard` directly; no selection state.
- List wrapper `EventPreviewList.tsx` is lightweight; might be safer to introduce selection at TextInputForm level (since state exists there) or create context/provider.
- Top toolbar location: inside results region, above event list.
- Existing util `calendarLinks.ts` (single-event) can be extended for multi-event ICS build & provider URL loops.

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Single source of selection truth**: manage selected IDs in React state at the parent level (TextInputForm) and pass selection & toggle callbacks to each card.
2. **Accessible checkboxes**: each card gets a leading `Checkbox` with `aria-label` referencing event title.
3. **Select All**: store `allSelected` derived from selectedIDs length === events length; provide master checkbox in toolbar.
4. **Batch action toolbar**: `MUI` `Toolbar` or `Box` with buttons; disable buttons when no events selected.
5. **Multi-event ICS**: generate single ICS string with BEGIN:VCALENDAR at top, one VEVENT per event, END:VCALENDAR once.
6. **Provider URLs**: loop through selected events and open each URL in new tab (limit: up to ~5 at once; if >5, show confirm dialog or show message to use ICS instead).
7. **Error Handling**: wrap link openings in try/catch; show `Snackbar` per failure but continue processing.

### Implementation Strategy (High-level)

1. **Phase-1 segmentation**: `segmentText(text)` prompt returns `{ chunks: [{ id, text }] }`, max 10.
2. **Phase-2 extraction**: For each chunk call `parseEventChunk(text)` which returns full event JSON (strict schema).
3. Orchestrate in `extractEvents` with parallel `Promise.all` and validation.
4. Error handling: skip chunks that fail validation, throw if none succeed.
5. API/Frontend unchanged beyond new `events` structure already handled.

## Initial Research Questions for Multi-event Parsing

1. What are the specific challenges in parsing multiple events from a single text?
2. How can we ensure that the parser accurately identifies and separates multiple events?
3. What are the potential issues with event date and time formatting in multi-event texts?
4. How can we handle different event formats and styles in multi-event texts?
5. What are the best practices for organizing and displaying multi-event texts?

## User Preference Questions for Multi-event Parsing

- Do you prefer a single event parser or a multi-event parser?
- How important is the accuracy of event separation in multi-event texts?
- How important is the consistency of event formatting in multi-event texts?
- How important is the organization of event information in multi-event texts?
- How important is the readability of multi-event texts?

## User Preference Answers (2025-06-12)

- Selection: Use multi-event parser.
- Accuracy: Very important.
- Consistency: Important.
- Organization: Important.
- Readability: Important.
  +API approach: Replace existing response entirely with new schema `{ success, events: [] }` (no backward-compat field).
  +Max events per parse: 10.
  +Confidence granularity: Overall per event (drop per-field scores).

### Web Research Findings (2025-06-13)

- Best approach is to instruct the LLM to return an **array** of events (max 10) in JSON, each with fields: `title`, `description`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `location`, `timezone`, `confidence` (overall 0-1), `summary`.
- Use a **function-calling schema** or OpenAI Chat with `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` and clarify array structure.
- Prompt techniques: number events in analysis, then output JSON `{"events": [...]}`.
- RFC 5545: date-times in local TZ w/ offset to avoid ambiguous UTC conversion.
- Token considerations: 10-event prompt within gpt-4o-mini context ~ < 8k tokens.

### Codebase Analysis Notes (2025-06-13)

- `app/api/ai/parse-events/route.ts` currently expects single event, transforms to `event` key.
- `lib/ai.ts` returns `ExtractedEventData` object; update to return `ExtractedEventData[]` and rename to `ExtractedEvent`.
- `TextInputForm.tsx` & downstream UI already use `ParsedEvent[]` so minimal frontend change; only helper in `calendar-parser/page.tsx` needs update.
- Tests exist in `tests/unit/api/` for single-event parsing; must refactor.

### Best Practices Identified

1. Limit to 10 events to control token & UI load; return error if >10 detected.
2. Overall confidence per event keeps payload small.
3. Strict JSON schema in prompt + use `zod` runtime validation in API route.
4. Break changes cleanlyâ€”since no users yet, **replace** existing schema; update all callers.
5. Provide graceful error message for "no events found".

### Implementation Strategy (High-level)

1. **Phase-1 segmentation**: `segmentText(text)` prompt returns `{ chunks: [{ id, text }] }`, max 10.
2. **Phase-2 extraction**: For each chunk call `parseEventChunk(text)` which returns full event JSON (strict schema).
3. Orchestrate in `extractEvents` with parallel `Promise.all` and validation.
4. Error handling: skip chunks that fail validation, throw if none succeed.
5. API/Frontend unchanged beyond new `events` structure already handled.
