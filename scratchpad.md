# Project Setup Scratchpad

This document tracks progress, decisions, and issues encountered during the project setup.

## Codebase AnalysisAI Prompt

I'm creating a github template with nextjs, authjs, and psql. The idea is for this to be used by AI when starting new project. The AI, if appropriate for the project, will pull from this template to get started. I've been getting AI to vibe code projects and it always takes a day or two at the start to get it to slowly set up the basics (especially auth). I want that step to be minutes instead of hours.

I'm going to paste the entire codebase below.

I want you to analyze it for best practices. This should be a simple, elegant, ready to use out of the box template, so look for anything that could be improved. I want the architecture to be clean and following best practices and solid principles.

I want you to be very thorough here. Break it down into clear sections or tasks that can be addressed item by item. I want this template to be production ready.

## Caveats For AI analysis:

- Placeholders: These are intentional. Because this is a base project I plan to install a plugin that leads the user through customizing it for their uses and replacing those placeholders. Igore them for now.
- Outdated Project Documentation: It's currently outdated as it's going to get updated all at once at the end of the project. Just ignore the docs for now. The CODE-level documention should be 100% accurate, though.
- Redundant Cursor Rules: Just ignore them. They're mind to deal with.

Here is the code:

## Codebase SUBSSYSTEM AnalysisAI Prompt

I'm creating a github template with nextjs, authjs, and psql. The idea is for this to be used by AI when starting new project. The AI, if appropriate for the project, will pull from this template to get started. I've been getting AI to vibe code projects and it always takes a day or two at the start to get it to slowly set up the basics (especially auth). I want that step to be minutes instead of hours.

I'm going to paste the entire codebase below.

I want you to analyze just a single subsystem for best practices. This should be a simple, elegant, ready to use out of the box template, so look for anything that should be removed, enhanced, or added to get it to that perfect state.

## Caveats For AI analysis:

- Placeholders: These are intentional. Because this is a base project I plan to install a plugin that leads the user through customizing it for their uses and replacing those placeholders. Igore them for now.
- Redundant Cursor Rules: Just ignore them. They're mind to deal with.
- We have strict eslinting rules for code complexity/length/etc. So don't suggest anything that would violate those rules.

For this round, the subsystem I want you to analyze is:

- [ ] **Redis Integration** (Files: `lib/redis.ts`, Redis-specific services)

Note that this may not be all of the files, so be sure to look at the entire codebase.

Here is the code:

Double check your suggestions. Verify they're best practice and not already implmented.

Then make a comprehensive list of all of your suggestions to improve the codebase as a markdown checklist with checkboxes. Be sure to include as much detail as possible as I'll be giving it to another AI to implement.

Keep in mind this project is meant to be an easy-to-use template for getting projects started, so best practices that are costly and mostly relevant to larger features/installations, or future features that may not be required, should not be included. The user of the template can add those later if required. The project is meant to be a clean, simple, elegant, easy to use starting point.

Use this methodolgy: - Attempt to upgrade and make sure nothing broke - If it's okay, then run all tests (npm run test and npm run test:e2e). You have permission to run these commands. - If they pass, ask me to manually check the website. - THEN check it off as successful.

- NOTE: The "Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:" error in Chrome is caused by a personal plugin injecting stuff into the UI and isn't a real error.

### Code To Do

- [ ] add global rules for consistency. Research best practices and encode them. Cursor â€“ Large Codebases: https://docs.cursor.com/guides/
- [ ] Refine: get gemini 2.5 to analyze each subsystem alone
  - [x] **Authentication System** (Files: `app/api/auth/`, `lib/auth-node.ts`, `lib/auth-edge.ts`, `lib/auth-shared.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `components/auth/`)
  - [x] **API Endpoints (Non-Auth)** (Files: `app/api/health/`, `app/api/user/`, `app/api/log/client/`, etc.)
  - [x] **Core UI Components** (Files: `components/ui/`, `components/forms/`)
    - [x] **`CardDescription.tsx` (within `Card.tsx`) - ARIA Enhancement**: Removed hardcoded `aria-describedby` from CardDescription component to allow more flexible accessibility relationships. Added JSDoc comments to guide proper usage.
    - [x] **`Input.tsx` - Documentation Update**: Created an updated documentation file (`docs/project-reference-updated.mdc`) that correctly describes Input.tsx as a styled MUI input component without variants.
    - [x] **`Snackbar.tsx` - Enhance Configurability**: Added configurable `anchorOrigin` prop with sensible default to allow users to customize toast positioning.
    - [x] **`Toaster.tsx` - Enhance Configurability**: Added configurable `anchorOrigin` prop to the Toaster component for global toast positioning control.
    - [x] **Implement `DateTimePicker.tsx` - Missing Core Component**: Created a comprehensive DateTimePicker component using MUI X Date Pickers with proper React Hook Form integration and full test coverage.
    - [x] **`DateTimePicker.tsx` - API Alignment**: Renamed the `inputFormat` prop to `format` in the DateTimePickerProps interface to align with the current MUI X Date Pickers library conventions. Updated component implementation to use the new prop name.
    - [x] **`Toaster.tsx` - Remove Ineffective Styling for Stacking**: Removed the `sx={{ mb: toasts.indexOf(toast) * 8 }}` prop from the `Snackbar` component within `Toaster.tsx` as it doesn't effectively create spacing between toasts due to how MUI Snackbars are absolutely positioned.
  - [x] **Application Pages and Layouts** (Files: `app/` (excluding `api/`), `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/`, `app/login/`, `app/register/`, `app/profile/`, `app/about/`, `components/layouts/`)
    - [x] **Standardize Styling in Error Pages to MUI**: Refactored `app/dashboard/error.tsx` and `app/profile/error.tsx` to use MUI components for layout and styling instead of Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring consistency with the rest of the application.
    - [x] **Simplify `useRouter` Hook Usage in `app/page.tsx`**: Replaced the complex `useCallback` approach with direct import and usage of the `useRouter` hook from 'next/navigation', making the code more straightforward and maintainable.

  - [x] **Database Interaction & Schema** (Files: `lib/prisma.ts`, `prisma/` schema, Prisma-interacting services)
    - [x] **Refactor `getUserSessionCountsByDay` for Proper Parameterization**: Updated the method to correctly pass parameters from `buildDateUserWhereClause` to the `$queryRaw` call, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - [x] **Refactor `buildSessionExpirationWhereClause` for Secure Parameterization**: Modified the method to return a parameterized where clause with an array of parameter values, supporting the ANY operator for proper array handling.
    - [x] **Refactor `extendSessionExpirations` for Secure Date Handling**: Updated to use parameterized queries for user IDs and dates, with proper interval handling.
    - [x] **Refactor `buildActivityWhereClause` for Parameterization**: Updated to use placeholders for date filtering with parameter values.
    - [x] **Refactor `executeActivitySummaryQuery` and `getUserActivitySummary` for Full Parameterization**: Modified to properly parameterize all user inputs (since date, minSessionCount, limit) using placeholder syntax.
  - [x] **State Management & Client-Side Logic** (Files: `app/providers/`, custom hooks, context providers)
  - [x] **Utility Libraries and Shared Functions** (Files: `lib/` (excluding auth, prisma, redis), `lib/utils/`)

    - [x] **Consolidate E2E Smoke Tests**: Removed redundant basic.spec.ts test file as its functionality is covered by the more comprehensive smoke.spec.ts.
    - [x] **Remove Potentially Orphaned/Redundant Theme Mock**: Removed duplicate next-themes.js mock file from tests/mocks directory, keeping only the one in the root **mocks** directory which is automatically used by Jest.
    - [x] **Remove Unnecessary Transpiler Verification Tests**: Deleted unnecessary SWC transpiler verification tests that were not essential for application testing.
    - [x] **Clean Up Outdated Playwright Setup Files**: Removed outdated global-setup.ts and auth.setup.ts files from the tests/e2e directory, keeping only the current version in tests/e2e/setup/.
    - [x] **Enable Disabled Tests**: Enabled the disabled test in dashboard.spec.ts but kept environment check tests skipped in auth-edge.additional.test.ts due to their flaky nature.
    - [x] **Improve the Main `npm test` Script**: Updated the main npm test script to run both unit and E2E tests for more comprehensive validation.
    - [x] **Relocate Debugging Helper Scripts**: Confirmed that debug helper scripts are already correctly located in the scripts/test-debug-helpers directory.
    - [x] **Testing Suite Enhancement Checklist**: Completed comprehensive testing suite improvements including:

  - [x] **Build, Configuration, and DX Scripts** (Files: `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc`, `package.json` scripts, `scripts/`)
  - [x] **Styling and Theming** (Files: `app/globals.css`, `components/ui/theme/`)
    - [x] **1. Remove Redundant Global Styles**: Successfully removed redundant CSS rules for light/dark mode styling that were being handled by MUI's ThemeProvider and CssBaseline.
    - [x] **2. Abstract Theme Names into Constants for Maintainability**: Theme constants were already properly implemented - verified `lib/constants/theme.ts` exists with proper `THEME_MODES` constants and both `ThemeMenu.tsx` and `ThemeToggle.tsx` are using these constants correctly.
  - [x] **Redis Integration** (Files: `lib/redis.ts`, Redis-specific services)
- [ ] try to upgrade everything again
- [x] Ensure the AI or the `scripts/setup.js` adequately handles providing/replacing all necessary environment variables before the first build/run attempt, particularly due to the strict validation in `lib/env.ts`.
  - Ensure the setup script (`scripts/setup.js`) correctly replaces _all_ placeholders (e.g., `Next Auth Application`, `Your Name`, etc.) across all relevant files (`README.md`, `package.json`, code comments, etc.).
- [x] Final round: search for unused vars/code/files/packages/etc.
- [x] AutoGen(?) to do a FULL e2e test: download github repo, run setup script, run e2e test, take notes on issues/improvements: https://chatgpt.com/share/681acf9d-93fc-800a-a8cc-3e360a7a85be"

### Redis Integration Enhancement Checklist

Here is a list of suggested improvements for the Redis integration subsystem.

- [x] **1. Abstract Rate Limiting into a Dedicated Service**

  - **Reasoning**: Currently, the logic for Redis-based rate limiting is implemented directly within the `registerUserAction` server action in `lib/actions/auth.actions.ts`. This tightly couples the authentication logic to the Redis implementation. By abstracting this into a `RateLimiterService`, we can adhere to the Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion principles. This makes the code cleaner, easier to test in isolation, and allows for easier replacement of the rate-limiting backend in the future without changing the authentication code.
  - **Suggested Implementation**:

    1.  Create a new file at `lib/services/rate-limiter.service.ts`.
    2.  Add the following code to the new file. This service will encapsulate all direct Redis interactions for rate limiting.

        ```typescript
        // lib/services/rate-limiter.service.ts
        import { getOptionalRedisClient } from '@/lib/redis';
        import { env } from '@/lib/env';
        import { logger } from '@/lib/logger';

        const log = logger.child({ service: 'RateLimiterService' });

        interface RateLimitResult {
          limited: boolean;
          error: boolean;
        }

        class RateLimiterServiceImpl {
          /**
           * Checks if a given key has exceeded the rate limit.
           *
           * @param key - A unique identifier for the action being rate-limited (e.g., `register:127.0.0.1`).
           * @returns A promise that resolves to an object indicating if the request is limited.
           */
          public async check(key: string): Promise<RateLimitResult> {
            const redisClient = getOptionalRedisClient();
            if (!redisClient) {
              log.warn(
                { key },
                'Redis client not available, skipping rate limit check (fail-open).'
              );
              return { limited: false, error: false }; // Fail open
            }

            const maxAttempts = env.RATE_LIMIT_REGISTER_MAX_ATTEMPTS;
            const windowSeconds = env.RATE_LIMIT_REGISTER_WINDOW_SECONDS;
            const redisKey = `rate-limit:${key}`;

            try {
              const pipeline = redisClient.pipeline();
              pipeline.incr(redisKey);
              pipeline.expire(redisKey, windowSeconds);
              const results = await pipeline.exec();

              // Check for pipeline execution errors
              if (!results) {
                log.error({ redisKey }, 'Redis pipeline for rate limiting returned null.');
                return { limited: false, error: true }; // Fail open on error
              }

              const [[incrErr, currentAttempts], [expireErr]] = results;

              if (incrErr || expireErr) {
                log.error(
                  { redisKey, incrErr, expireErr },
                  'Error in Redis rate-limiting command.'
                );
                return { limited: false, error: true }; // Fail open on error
              }

              if (typeof currentAttempts !== 'number') {
                log.error({ redisKey, currentAttempts }, 'Invalid result from Redis INCR command.');
                return { limited: false, error: true }; // Fail open on error
              }

              if (currentAttempts > maxAttempts) {
                log.warn({ redisKey, currentAttempts, maxAttempts }, 'Rate limit exceeded.');
                return { limited: true, error: false };
              }

              return { limited: false, error: false };
            } catch (error) {
              log.error({ redisKey, error }, 'Exception during Redis rate limit check.');
              return { limited: false, error: true }; // Fail open on error
            }
          }
        }

        export const RateLimiterService = new RateLimiterServiceImpl();
        ```

    3.  Open `lib/actions/auth.actions.ts` and refactor the `_handleRegistrationRateLimit` function to use the new service.

        - **Remove** the old `_checkRegistrationRateLimit` and `_executeRateLimitPipeline` helper functions from this file.
        - **Replace** the entire `_handleRegistrationRateLimit` function with the following simplified version:

          ```typescript
          // In lib/actions/auth.actions.ts

          // Add this import at the top
          import { RateLimiterService } from '@/lib/services/rate-limiter.service';

          // Replace the existing _handleRegistrationRateLimit with this new version
          async function _handleRegistrationRateLimit(
            log: Logger,
            logContext: LogContext,
            clientIp: string | null | undefined
          ): Promise<RegistrationResult | null> {
            if (!env.ENABLE_REDIS_RATE_LIMITING) {
              log.info(logContext, 'Redis rate limiting is disabled. Skipping check.');
              return null;
            }
            if (!clientIp) {
              log.warn(logContext, 'Client IP not available, skipping rate limit check.');
              return null;
            }

            const { limited, error } = await RateLimiterService.check(`register:${clientIp}`);

            if (error) {
              // Fail-open: If the rate limiter service has an error, we allow registration to proceed.
              log.error(
                { ...logContext, clientIp },
                'Rate limiter service failed. Allowing registration to proceed.'
              );
              return null;
            }

            if (limited) {
              log.warn({ ...logContext, clientIp }, 'Rate limit exceeded for registration.');
              return {
                status: 'error',
                error: {
                  code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED',
                  message: 'Too many registration attempts. Please try again later.',
                },
              };
            }

            return null;
          }
          ```

- [x] **2. Add Command Timeouts for Production Hardening**

  - **Reasoning**: While `connectTimeout` is set, `ioredis` does not apply a timeout to individual commands by default. In a production scenario, a Redis command could hang due to network issues or a slow query, which would block the Node.js event loop. Adding a `commandTimeout` ensures that no single command can indefinitely stall the application.
  - **Suggested Implementation**:

    1.  Open the file `lib/redis.ts`.
    2.  Locate the `_attemptRedisClientInstantiation` function.
    3.  Add the `commandTimeout` option to the `Redis` constructor options object.

        ```typescript
        // In lib/redis.ts, inside _attemptRedisClientInstantiation

        const client = new Redis(redisUrlToUse, {
          maxRetriesPerRequest: 3,
          connectTimeout: 5000,
          commandTimeout: 1000, // Add this line (1000ms is a sensible default)
          showFriendlyErrorStack: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
          retryStrategy: _createRedisRetryStrategy(baseLogger, redisUrlToUse),
        });
        ```

- [x] **3. Implement Graceful Shutdown**

  - **Reasoning**: A production application must handle shutdown signals (like `SIGTERM` in Docker or `SIGINT` via Ctrl+C) cleanly. Without a graceful shutdown handler, the Redis connection might be terminated abruptly, leaving open connections. This change ensures the application explicitly closes its connection to Redis before exiting.
  - **Suggested Implementation**:

    1.  Open the file `instrumentation.ts`.
    2.  Modify the file to include listeners for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals.

        ```typescript
        // instrumentation.ts

        export async function register() {
          if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {
            console.log('[Instrumentation] Initializing server-side components...');

            const { redisClient } = await import('@/lib/redis');

            // Graceful shutdown handler
            const gracefulShutdown = async (signal: string) => {
              console.log(`Received ${signal}, shutting down gracefully...`);
              if (redisClient) {
                try {
                  await redisClient.quit();
                  console.log('Redis client disconnected successfully.');
                } catch (err) {
                  console.error('Error during Redis disconnection:', err);
                }
              }
              process.exit(0);
            };

            // Listen for termination signals
            process.on('SIGTERM', () => gracefulShutdown('SIGTERM'));
            process.on('SIGINT', () => gracefulShutdown('SIGINT'));

            console.log('[Instrumentation] Redis client initialization sequence initiated.');
          }
        }
        ```
