# RESEARCH PHASE PROTOCOL

## OBJECTIVE
Conduct thorough research on the specified topic using web search and codebase analysis to establish best practices and current implementation patterns.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **VERIFY WEB ACCESS**
   - If you don't have @Web access, HALT immediately and request it from the user.
   - This step is mandatory as comprehensive research requires external knowledge.

2. **WEB RESEARCH**
   - Search for current best practices, patterns, and standards related to the topic.
   - Focus on authoritative sources (official documentation, reputable blogs, GitHub repos).
   - Note version-specific recommendations relevant to the project's dependencies.
   - Identify common pitfalls, performance considerations, and security implications.

3. **CODEBASE ANALYSIS**
   - Search the entire codebase for relevant implementations and patterns.
   - Identify how the topic is currently handled in the project.
   - Note inconsistencies between current implementation and best practices.
   - Look for related dependencies and configurations.

4. **SYNTHESIZE FINDINGS**
   - Create a concise summary of best practices with specific code examples where helpful.
   - Highlight gaps between current implementation and recommended approaches.
   - List potential improvements organized by priority (critical, important, nice-to-have).
   - Include links to key references for further reading.

5. **USER REVIEW**
   - Present your research findings clearly and concisely.
   - Ask the user: "I've completed the research phase. Would you like me to proceed to the planning phase, or do you have any questions about my findings?"
   - DO NOT proceed to the planning phase without explicit user confirmation.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Keep summaries focused and relevant - avoid overwhelming detail.
- Prioritize actionable insights over theoretical concepts.
- Ensure recommendations align with the project's goal of being minimal, elegant, and following best practices.
- Consider the technological context and compatibility with existing architecture.
