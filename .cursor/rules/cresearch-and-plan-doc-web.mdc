Please research this topic in great detail.

I want this codebase to be as close to best practices as possible and for it to be used as a perfect base project, ready to go and easy to use out of the box. I want people to point to this codebase as a perfect example of best practices balanced with minimal, elegant code.

Once you're done researching, check the entire codebase and compare what we have to the best practices you've researched.

Create a comprehensive markdown checklist of work we need to do to accomplish that best practices solution.

If you have essential questions, ask them before doing the work.
