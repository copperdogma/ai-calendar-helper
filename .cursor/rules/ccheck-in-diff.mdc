NOTE: If you weren't given access to @Diff you can't do this job. Halt and ask for @Diff access.

1. Check all changes into main using: git add .
2. Check what was added, verifying that all of those files should be committed and that no secrets or things that should be in .gitignore got in. If they did, fix it.
3. Commit, adding an appropriate commit message based on the @Diff. Use the -m flag to add multiple lines as newlines will be rejected.
4. Push to main

If any of the CI/triggered tests fail (except linting, it's okay if some of those fail) do NOT attempt to bypass them and check in. Halt.
