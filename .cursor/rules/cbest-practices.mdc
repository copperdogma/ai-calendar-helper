Remember we want all code and decisions to exemplify best practices. If you're not 100% sure what best practice is in this situation, search the web or check the docs.

I want this project to be a perfect example of how to code this and to be used as a excellent base project for AI-driven workflows, ready to go and easy to use out of the box. The final code should be 100% best practices, minimal, and elegant.
