# RESEARCH & PLANNING PHASE PROTOCOL

## OBJECTIVE
Conduct comprehensive research and develop a detailed implementation plan for the specified topic, maintaining scratchpad.md as your persistent memory throughout the entire process.

## INITIAL SETUP (REQUIRED)
1. **ADD HIGH-LEVEL CHECKLIST TO SCRATCHPAD**
   - Upon receiving this task, immediately update scratchpad.md with a new section titled "## [Task Name] Research & Planning Checklist"
   - Include these mandatory checklist items:
     - [ ] Initial research questions identified
     - [ ] Web research completed
     - [ ] Codebase analysis completed
     - [ ] Best practices identified
     - [ ] Implementation strategy developed
     - [ ] Detailed implementation checklist created
     - [ ] User preference questions identified and asked
     - [ ] Plan reviewed and approved by user

## RESEARCH PHASE

1. **VERIFY WEB ACCESS**
   - If you don't have web access, HALT immediately and request it from the user.
   - Update scratchpad.md with: "ðŸ›‘ Blocked: Web access required for research."

2. **IDENTIFY QUESTIONS & PREFERENCES (REQUIRED)**
   - List specific questions about user preferences that will impact your implementation
   - Ask these questions EARLY in the conversation
   - Update scratchpad.md with both questions and answers
   - Example: "Do you prefer approach A or B for handling authentication?"

3. **WEB RESEARCH**
   - Search for current best practices, patterns, and standards related to the topic
   - Use the MCP tool "deepwiki fetch" to get docs on anything you need
   - Focus on recent and authoritative sources
   - Document key findings directly in scratchpad.md as you discover them
   - Update checklist items as you complete them

4. **CODEBASE ANALYSIS**
   - Search the entire codebase for relevant implementations and patterns
   - Identify how similar features are currently implemented
   - Note inconsistencies between current implementation and best practices
   - Document findings in scratchpad.md

## PLANNING PHASE

5. **SYNTHESIZE FINDINGS & DEVELOP STRATEGY**
   - Create a concise summary in scratchpad.md of:
     - Key best practices identified
     - Recommended implementation approach
     - Technical constraints and considerations
     - User preference decisions

6. **CREATE DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**
   - Add a new section to scratchpad.md titled "## Implementation Checklist"
   - Break down implementation into logically sequenced, specific tasks
   - Include acceptance criteria for each task
   - Estimate complexity (simple, moderate, complex)
   - Begin with reminder that all code should follow best practices (SOLID, DRY, etc.)

7. **IDENTIFY RISKS & MITIGATIONS**
   - List potential implementation challenges
   - Document mitigation strategies for each risk
   - Include these in scratchpad.md

## USER INTERACTION

8. **ONGOING PREFERENCE CHECKS (REQUIRED)**
   - At MINIMUM, ask for user preferences at these points:
     - After initial research to confirm direction
     - When multiple implementation approaches are viable
     - Before finalizing the implementation plan
   - Update scratchpad.md with all user preference decisions

9. **USER REVIEW**
   - Present your complete plan referencing scratchpad.md
   - Highlight any remaining questions that need clarification
   - If creating a story, capture all requirements, decisions, and the master markdown checklist in the new story file
   - Ask: "I've completed the research and planning phase. Would you like me to proceed to implementation, or do you have any feedback on the plan?"
   - DO NOT proceed without explicit user confirmation

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Keep updating scratchpad.md throughout the ENTIRE process - it's your external memory
- Prioritize user preferences over your own recommendations when they conflict
- Focus on creating a minimal, elegant solution aligned with the project's goals
- Always follow the principle: "Ask, don't assume" for significant design decisions
- Remember the project goal is to be a clean, simple, elegant starting point
