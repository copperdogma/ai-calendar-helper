Run all validation, unit, and e2e tests and report back, giving triaged recommendations for any warnings or errors. Then start fixing the issues according to your recommendations, repeating the tests and fixes until all tests pass.

Unless the fix would be incredibly arduous, do not suggest modifying test thresholds.
