# PLANNING PHASE PROTOCOL

## OBJECTIVE
Create a comprehensive implementation plan based on research findings that will guide the development process in alignment with best practices.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **VERIFY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS**
   - If you don't have @Web access to conduct research, HALT immediately and request it from the user.
   - Search the entire codebase to understand current implementation patterns and standards.

2. **REVIEW RESEARCH FINDINGS**
   - Carefully analyze the research findings from the previous phase.
   - Identify key requirements, constraints, and technical approaches.
   - Note any gaps in the research that need clarification before planning.

3. **DEVELOP IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**
   - Determine the most suitable architectural approach based on research.
   - Break down the implementation into logical components/modules.
   - Consider dependencies between components and establish a logical sequence.
   - Identify potential technical challenges and formulate solutions.

4. **CREATE DETAILED CHECKLIST**
   - Develop a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation checklist.
   - Include specific tasks for each component with clear acceptance criteria.
   - Organize tasks in a logical sequence with dependencies clearly marked.
   - Estimate complexity for each task (simple, moderate, complex).
   - Append this checklist to the end of the scratchpad.md file.
   - Begin the checklist with a reminder that all code should follow best practices (SOLID, DRY, DI, etc.).

5. **IDENTIFY POTENTIAL RISKS**
   - List possible implementation challenges or roadblocks.
   - Suggest mitigation strategies for each identified risk.
   - Note areas where additional research might be needed during implementation.

6. **USER REVIEW**
   - Present your plan clearly and concisely.
   - Highlight any questions or areas needing clarification.
   - Ask: "I've completed the planning phase. Would you like me to proceed to the implementation phase, or do you have any questions about the plan?"
   - DO NOT proceed to the implementation phase without explicit user confirmation.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Keep your plan focused and aligned with the project's goal of being minimal, elegant, and following best practices.
- Ensure the implementation checklist is detailed enough to guide development but not overwhelming.
- Consider the technological context and compatibility with existing architecture.
- Remember that your plan should be realistic given the constraints of AI implementation capabilities.
