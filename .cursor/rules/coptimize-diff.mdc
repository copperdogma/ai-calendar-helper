# Optimizing Our Work

NOTE: If you weren't given access to @Diff you can't do this job. Halt and ask for @Diff access.

Check over the changes made in the diff and do the following:

1. Ensure they meet the original requirements.
2. Make sure there's no abandoned code leftover from approaches that didn't work.
3. Ensure we're following best practices: SOLID, DRY, TDD, YAGNI, etc.
4. Ensure all code is as efficient, minimal, and elegant as possible.
