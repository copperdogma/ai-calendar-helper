# Creating a Milestone

NOTE: If you need to review changes, use `gh` CLI commands to get the diff (e.g., `git diff`, `gh pr diff`, or `gh repo view --json`).

1. Check the @Diff to get a sense of what was done.
2. Add a new milestone to the top of [log.md](mdc:docs/log.md) with the changes
3. Check all changes into main using: git add .
4. Commit, adding an appropriate commit message based on the @Diff
5. Push to main
