## Alignment with Design

Refer to [Design.md â€“ About Page](../design.md#about-page)

## Acceptance Criteria

- The About page clearly describes the two main functions: "Calendar Parser" and upcoming "Calendar Summarizer".
- The page includes a brief narrative about the purpose/motivation for the project, noting it is **100% AI-written**.
- A concise explanation of how the application works (AI parsing, event creation, summarization) is included.
- Content is styled using existing typography and supports dark/light themes automatically.
- The About page passes accessibility checks (e.g., headings structure, color contrast).
- Unit tests verify that the new content renders and contains expected text.
- Story passes lint, type-check, and existing test suites.
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete.

## Tasks

- [ ] Draft new content copy for About page sections: Purpose, Features (Parser & Summarizer), How It Works, Built by AI.
- [ ] Update `app/about/page.tsx` (or equivalent component) with new content using Material-UI components (Typography, Box, Card if needed).
- [ ] Ensure Dark Mode compatibility using theme palette.
- [ ] Add any relevant links (e.g., GitHub repo, learn more).
- [ ] Write unit tests to assert presence of key content strings.
- [ ] Update documentation (README, design docs) if necessary.
- [ ] Peer review, lint, type-check.

## Notes

This update provides users with transparent context about the application's capabilities and origins. The "Calendar Summarizer" feature is not yet implemented but should be mentioned to set expectation for future functionality.
