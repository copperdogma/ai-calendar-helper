# Story: Implement E2E Testing with Playwright

**Status**: Done

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Playwright configured with projects for public, authenticated, and setup flows.
- Critical user journeys (login, calendar parsing, accessibility scan) are covered.
- Tests run headless in CI and locally with `npm run test:e2e`.
- Selectors are resilient (data-testid) and no strict mode violations.

## Implementation Summary

- Added Playwright config plus 20+ specs across `tests/e2e/`.
- Browser automation includes auth setup via NextAuth session fixtures.
- Accessibility suite uses axe-core integration; landmark violations fixed.
- Visual regression snapshots stored under `visual.spec.ts-snapshots`.
