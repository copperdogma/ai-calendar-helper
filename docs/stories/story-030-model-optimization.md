# Story: Research Optimal AI Model for Calendar Entry Parsing

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement

[Requirement #3: AI Text Processing](docs/requirements.md#ai-text-processing) - The system should efficiently and accurately parse natural language text into calendar events with optimal cost-performance ratio.

## Alignment with Design

[Design Section 3.2: AI Service Architecture](docs/design.md#ai-service-architecture) - This story supports the ongoing optimization of our AI processing pipeline for better performance and cost efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Evaluate at least 3 different AI models/providers for calendar entry parsing accuracy
- [ ] Compare cost per request for each model option
- [ ] Benchmark processing time and reliability for each model
- [ ] Test edge cases and complex input scenarios across models
- [ ] Document findings with clear recommendations for production use
- [ ] Implement the chosen optimal model configuration
- [ ] Ensure JSON-only output is properly configured for the selected model
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete.

## Tasks

- [ ] Research available AI models suitable for structured data extraction (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- [ ] Set up test framework for model comparison
- [ ] Create standardized test cases for calendar parsing scenarios
- [ ] Test accuracy across different input complexity levels
- [ ] Measure and document cost per request for each model
- [ ] Benchmark average processing times
- [ ] Test reliability and error rates under various conditions
- [ ] Document JSON output consistency for each model
- [ ] Analyze results and create recommendation report
- [ ] Implement the optimal model configuration
- [ ] Update AI service configuration with JSON-only output constraints
- [ ] Update documentation with new model choice and rationale

## Notes

**Current State**: Using GPT-4 with good accuracy but potentially higher cost than necessary.

**Key Considerations**:

- Balance between accuracy and cost for production scaling
- Processing time requirements (current target: <15 seconds)
- JSON output reliability and consistency
- Support for complex calendar scenarios (recurring events, timezones, etc.)
- Rate limiting and API reliability

**Test Scenarios to Include**:

- Simple events: "Lunch tomorrow at 1pm"
- Complex events with locations: "Board meeting next Tuesday 2-4pm at conference room A"
- Multi-event text: "Dentist Monday 10am, dinner with Sarah Friday 7pm"
- Edge cases: ambiguous times, missing information, conflicting data

**Success Metrics**:

- 95%+ accuracy on standard calendar parsing scenarios
- Cost reduction of 20%+ if possible without accuracy loss
- Processing time under 10 seconds for typical inputs
- 99%+ JSON output format compliance
