# Story: Location Parsing and Map Integration

**Status**: To Do

---

## Related Requirement

[Requirement #3: AI Text Processing](docs/requirements.md#ai-text-processing) - The system should extract location information from natural language and provide useful address resolution and map integration.

## Alignment with Design

[Design Section 3.2: AI Service Architecture](docs/design.md#ai-service-architecture) - This story enhances the AI parsing capabilities with location-aware features and integrates with mapping services for better user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research and document common approaches to location parsing and address resolution
- [ ] Evaluate mapping service options (Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap, etc.)
- [ ] Implement enhanced location extraction in AI parsing service
- [ ] Add address validation and standardization functionality
- [ ] Generate clickable map links for parsed locations
- [ ] Handle ambiguous locations with user-friendly suggestions
- [ ] Support common location formats (addresses, business names, landmarks)
- [ ] Display location information in event preview UI
- [ ] Test accuracy with various location input formats
- [ ] User must sign off on functionality before story can be marked complete.

## Tasks

### Research Phase

- [ ] Research industry best practices for location parsing from natural language
- [ ] Evaluate mapping service APIs and their capabilities:
  - [ ] Google Maps Platform (Places API, Geocoding API)
  - [ ] Apple MapKit JS
  - [ ] OpenStreetMap/Nominatim
  - [ ] Mapbox
- [ ] Analyze pricing models for different mapping services
- [ ] Research address standardization approaches
- [ ] Document common location input patterns and edge cases

### Implementation Phase

- [ ] Enhance AI prompt to better extract location information
- [ ] Implement location validation service with chosen mapping API
- [ ] Add address geocoding and reverse geocoding functionality
- [ ] Create location standardization logic (format addresses consistently)
- [ ] Implement map link generation (Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.)
- [ ] Handle location disambiguation (multiple matches for same name)
- [ ] Add location confidence scoring to AI response
- [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces to include location metadata
- [ ] Enhance UI components to display location information
- [ ] Add clickable map links in event preview
- [ ] Implement location editing/correction in UI
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for mapping service failures

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Create test cases for various location formats
- [ ] Test international address handling
- [ ] Validate map link generation across different platforms
- [ ] Test edge cases (invalid locations, ambiguous names)
- [ ] Performance testing for location API calls

## Notes

**Research Questions to Answer**:

- How do major calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar) handle location parsing?
- What's the standard approach for generating universal map links?
- How should we handle location privacy concerns?
- What's the best fallback strategy when mapping services are unavailable?

**Common Location Input Patterns**:

- Full addresses: "123 Main St, Anytown, CA 12345"
- Business names: "Starbucks on 5th Avenue"
- Landmarks: "Central Park"
- Ambiguous locations: "Downtown" (needs context)
- Virtual locations: "Zoom call", "Teams meeting"

**Mapping Service Considerations**:

- **Google Maps**: Most comprehensive, higher cost, best accuracy
- **Apple Maps**: Good for iOS users, limited web integration
- **OpenStreetMap**: Free, open source, varying data quality
- **Mapbox**: Developer-friendly, good customization, reasonable pricing

**Technical Implementation Options**:

1. **Server-side geocoding**: More secure API keys, better rate limiting
2. **Client-side geocoding**: Faster response, but exposes API keys
3. **Hybrid approach**: Critical lookups server-side, simple ones client-side

**Map Link Formats**:

- Google Maps: `https://maps.google.com/maps?q=[query]`
- Apple Maps: `https://maps.apple.com/?q=[query]`
- Universal: `geo:[lat],[lng]` protocol

**Location Data Structure**:

```typescript
interface ParsedLocation {
  raw: string; // Original text
  formatted: string; // Standardized address
  coordinates?: { lat: number; lng: number };
  confidence: number; // 0.0-1.0
  mapLinks?: {
    google?: string;
    apple?: string;
    universal?: string;
  };
  suggestions?: string[]; // For ambiguous locations
  type: 'address' | 'business' | 'landmark' | 'virtual';
}
```

**Success Metrics**:

- 90%+ accuracy for standard address formats
- 80%+ accuracy for business name resolution
- <2 seconds additional processing time for location resolution
- Support for at least 3 major mapping services
- Graceful degradation when mapping services are unavailable

**Future Enhancements** (not in scope for this story):

- Location-based event suggestions
- Travel time calculations between events
- Integration with user's preferred map application
- Offline location caching
