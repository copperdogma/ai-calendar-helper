# SOLID Principles Implementation

This document outlines how SOLID principles are enforced in this project through static analysis tools (primarily ESLint) and TypeScript features.

## Overview of SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class/module/function should have only one reason to change.

#### Enforcement Mechanisms:

- **ESLint Rules:**
  - `max-lines`: Max 300 lines per file, excluding comments and blank lines (warns)
  - `max-classes-per-file`: Max 1 class per file (warns)
  - `complexity`: Max cyclomatic complexity of 10 per function (errors)
  - `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity`: Max cognitive complexity of 15 per function (errors)
  - `max-depth`: Max nesting depth of 3 levels (errors)
  - `max-lines-per-function`: Max 50 lines per function, excluding comments and blank lines (warns)
  - `max-params`: Max 4 parameters per function (errors)
  - `max-statements`: Max 15 statements per function (warns)

#### Implementation Benefits:

- Smaller, more focused files and functions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved code readability and maintainability

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Enforcement Mechanisms:

- **ESLint Rules:**
  - `no-param-reassign`: Prevents direct modification of function parameters (errors)
  - `sonarjs/no-ignored-return`: Encourages immutability by warning when ignoring return values from methods that create new values (warns)

#### Implementation Benefits:

- Encourages immutable coding patterns
- Reduces side effects
- Makes code more predictable and easier to test

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

#### Enforcement Mechanisms:

- **TypeScript Configuration:**

  - `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` to enforce type compatibility between subtypes and base types
  - Strict function types, null checks, and other TypeScript strictness settings

- **Testing:**
  - Custom tests should verify that subclasses don't break parent contracts

#### Implementation Benefits:

- Ensures proper inheritance and polymorphism
- Helps catch type-related errors at compile time
- Prevents unexpected runtime behavior due to improper subtyping

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

#### Enforcement Mechanisms:

- **TypeScript Features:**

  - Use of focused interfaces and type definitions
  - Consistent type checking across the codebase

- **ESLint Rules:**
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: Helps identify if parts of a large interface are unused (errors)
  - `sonarjs/no-all-duplicated-branches`: Indirectly helps identify when interfaces could be better segregated (warns)

#### Implementation Benefits:

- More cohesive and focused interfaces
- Reduced dependencies between components
- Better adaptability to changing requirements

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

#### Enforcement Mechanisms:

- **ESLint Rules:**
  - `import/no-cycle`: Prevents circular dependencies, which often violate DIP (errors)

#### Implementation Benefits:

- Cleaner dependency structure
- Improved testability through dependency injection
- More flexibility when implementations change

## Configuration Details

These SOLID principles are enforced through ESLint configurations in `eslint.config.mjs`. The rules are applied to both JavaScript/JSX and TypeScript/TSX files with appropriate severity levels.

## Best Practices

When working with this codebase:

1. Keep files and functions small and focused on a single responsibility
2. Use composition over inheritance where possible
3. Create small, focused interfaces instead of large, general ones
4. Rely on TypeScript's type system to enforce proper subtyping
5. Avoid modifying function parameters directly
6. Prevent circular dependencies between modules
7. Use dependency injection to make components more testable

## Future Enhancements

For more strict SOLID enforcement, consider:

- Adding `eslint-plugin-functional` for stricter immutability rules
- Configuring `import/no-restricted-paths` to enforce architectural boundaries
- Implementing more comprehensive testing for validating LSP adherence
