# Scratchpad - Requirements Phase

**Current Phase**: MVP Requirements Gathering → Tech Stack Alignment

**MVP Checklist**
- [x] Define core problem and purpose:
  - [x] Who are the target users? Personal users wanting better calendar management
  - [x] What problem does this solve for them? Convert natural language to calendar events + get novel event summaries
  - [x] How will users measure success? Faster event creation, useful email summaries
- [x] Identify MVP features (must-haves only):
  - [x] Core functionality: Text-to-Calendar + Novel Events Extraction
  - [x] Critical constraints: Google Calendar integration, AI text processing
  - [x] Minimum user journey: Text input → Calendar event creation
- [x] Separate nice-to-haves from essentials:
  - [x] Future enhancements: Multi-calendar, smart categorization, etc.
  - [x] Stretch goals: Documented in requirements.md
- [x] Document in `/docs/requirements.md`:
  - [x] Clear MVP definition ✓
  - [x] Prioritized feature list ✓
  - [x] User stories for core flows ✓

**CURRENT TASK: Tech Stack Alignment**
- [x] User has chosen tech stack: Next.js + NextAuth.js + PostgreSQL template
- [x] Review design.md for conflicts with chosen template:
  - [x] Authentication: Updated from Firebase to NextAuth.js ✓
  - [x] Database: PostgreSQL matches ✓
  - [x] Caching: Redis matches ✓
  - [x] Framework: Next.js matches ✓
- [x] Update design.md to align with template architecture ✓
- [x] Confirm any other architectural decisions that need alignment

**Project Type Selection**
- [x] Determine appropriate project type: **Programming** (web application development)
- [x] Rationale: Building a web app with AI integration, database, and background services
- [ ] Get explicit confirmation of project type choice

**Ready to Build?**
- Tech stack chosen: Next.js + NextAuth.js + PostgreSQL template
- Requirements: Complete ✓
- Design: Needs alignment with chosen template
- Next step: Align design.md, then transition to programming project type
