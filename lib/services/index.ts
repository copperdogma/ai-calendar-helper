/**
 * Canonical service exports
 *
 * This module provides a single point of import for all service
 * implementations. These are the consolidated, canonical implementations
 * that should be used throughout the application.
 *
 * For better dependency initialization and testing support, prefer using
 * the getter functions from lib/server/services.ts when in server contexts.
 * These getters ensure proper initialization of dependencies like logging.

// Export all service implementations
